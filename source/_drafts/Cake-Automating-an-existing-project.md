Hi, my name is Jamie and I am a [Cake](http://cakebuild.net/) addin author that doesn't build my addins using Cake. This seems kind of wrong too me and this is a bonus for you. I am going to walk you through how to use Cake to build your project, run your tests, create a [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/) package, then publish to NuGet. I am going to walk you through performing this for my [Cake.XdtTransform](https://github.com/phillipsj/Cake.XdtTransform) project. The project is hosted on GitHub so you can see the final build. I am going to be using the wonderful extension created for VsCode and will be doing most of my work in it.
