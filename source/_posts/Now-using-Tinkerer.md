I have finally moved my blog over from Blogger to using [Tinkerer](http://tinkerer.me/) with hosting on Github Pages.
I do not know if I am going to move over older posts or just make a clean cut and start fresh.
Tinkerer is a project that using [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) as the backbone to build a static blogging framework.
So far I really like it and it also helps me get more familiar with Sphinx and [reStructeredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html).
