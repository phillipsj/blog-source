I was lucky enough that my company sent me to [CodeMash](http://www.codemash.org/). CodeMash is a pretty
awesome conference in Sandusky, OH at a huge indoor water park. There
was lots of great content, events, and people. I really enjoyed getting to meet
various developers, many of whom I have followed as they are developers that have been influential on my career either through there open source work and material that they
have authored. Also I realize that I need to start trying to use social media more than
I currently do, so know I can be found on Twitter [@phillipsj73](https://twitter.com/phillipsj73). I am planning to go to
CodeMash 2016 and I hope meet even more new developers and reconnect with the developers
that I had the pleasure to meet this year.
