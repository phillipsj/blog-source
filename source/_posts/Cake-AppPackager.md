Just published a new package called [Cake.AppPackager](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.AppPackager/). It integrates [App Packager](https://goo.gl/2g25OD) into the Cake pipeline so you can now create your Windows app packages using Cake.

Still need to add additional unit tests. Please feel free to open an issue in the [repo](https://github.com/phillipsj/Cake.AppPackager).
