EmberJS uses Handlebars as its template engine.
To extend it, you create what Ember calls helpers.
There are several ways in Ember to tackle a problem, but
some are more optimal than others.

I needed to create tags that use the **mailto** and **tel" attributes.
So achieve this I created helpers so my templates are a little more
semantic to read and understand what is happening.

The first helper I created was a mailto helper. Using Ember-CLI is a nice way
to get started. Remember that helpers kind of require a multipart name, so make sure
not to create one with a single name as it tends to generate errors in EmberJS. Another tip
is to make sure that you wrap your html tag in the Ember.Handlebars.SafeString method so it
doesnâ€™t escape the html when rendering.

Getting Started:

Lets create the mailto helper to start.

'''
$ ember g helper mailtoLink
'''

Now navigate to the helper file and add this code.

{% gist f27f6ee75de18b9a31af90fe4a700057 mailToLink.js %}

Now create the telLink helper to start.

'''
$ ember g helper telLink
'''

Now navigate to the helper file and add this code.

{% gist f27f6ee75de18b9a31af90fe4a700057 telLink.js %}

Now to use these you can just call these in your templates like so:

{% gist f27f6ee75de18b9a31af90fe4a700057 template.html %}

Ember makes lots of things really easy, but sometimes it not very clear how to
do others. Hope you find this helpful.
